 * @custom:name IReferencedPaymentNonexistence
 * @custom:id 0x04
 * @custom:supported BTC, DOGE, XRP
 * @author Flare
 * @notice Assertion that an agreed-upon payment has not been made by a certain deadline.
 * A confirmed request shows that a transaction meeting certain criteria (address, amount, reference)
 * did not appear in the specified block range.
 *
 *
 * This type of attestation can be used to e.g. provide grounds to liquidate funds locked by a smart
 * contract on Flare when a payment is missed.
 *
 * @custom:verification If `firstOverflowBlock` cannot be determined or does not have a sufficient
 * number of confirmations, the attestation request is rejected.
 * If `firstOverflowBlockNumber` is higher or equal to `minimalBlockNumber`, the request is rejected.
 * The search range are blocks between heights including `minimalBlockNumber` and excluding `firstOverflowBlockNumber`.
 * If the verifier does not have a view of all blocks from `minimalBlockNumber` to `firstOverflowBlockNumber`,
 * the attestation request is rejected.
 *
 * The request is confirmed if no transaction meeting the specified criteria is found in the search range.
 * The criteria and timestamp are chain specific.
 * ### UTXO (Bitcoin and Dogecoin)
 *
 *
 * Criteria for the transaction:
 *
 *
 * - It is not coinbase transaction.
 * - The transaction has the specified standardPaymentReference.
 * - The sum of values of all outputs with the specified address minus the sum of values of all inputs with
 * the specified address is greater than `amount` (in practice the sum of all values of the inputs with the
 * specified address is zero).
 *
 *
 * Timestamp is `mediantime`.
 * ### XRPL
 *
 *
 *
 * Criteria for the transaction:
 * - The transaction is of type payment.
 * - The transaction has the specified standardPaymentReference,
 * - One of the following is true:
 *   - Transaction status is `SUCCESS` and the amount received by the specified destination address is
 * greater than the specified `value`.
 *   - Transaction status is `RECEIVER_FAILURE` and the specified destination address would receive an
 * amount greater than the specified `value` had the transaction been successful.
 *
 *
 * Timestamp is `close_time` converted to UNIX time.
 *
 * @custom:lut `minimalBlockTimestamp`
 * @custom:lutlimit `0x127500`, `0x127500`, `0x127500`

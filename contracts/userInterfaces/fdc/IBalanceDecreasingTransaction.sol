 * @custom:name IBalanceDecreasingTransaction
 * @custom:id 0x02
 * @custom:supported BTC, DOGE, XRP
 * @author Flare
 * @notice A detection of a transaction that either decreases the balance for some address or is
 * signed by the source address.
 * Such an attestation could prove a violation of an agreement and therefore provides grounds to liquidate
 * some funds locked by a smart contract on Flare.
 *
 * A transaction is considered “balance decreasing” for the address, if the balance after the
 * transaction is lower than before or the address is among the signers of the transaction
 * (even if its balance is greater than before the transaction).
 * @custom:verification The transaction with `transactionId` is fetched from the API of the
 * source blockchain node or relevant indexer.
 * If the transaction cannot be fetched or the transaction is in a block that does not have a
 * sufficient number of confirmations, the attestation request is rejected.
 *
 * Once the transaction is received, the response fields are extracted if the transaction is balance
 * decreasing for the indicated address.
 * Some of the request and response fields are chain specific as described below.
 * The fields can be computed with the help of a balance decreasing summary.
 *
 * ### UTXO (Bitcoin and Dogecoin)
 *
 * - `sourceAddressIndicator` is the the index of the transaction input in hex padded to a 0x prefixed 32-byte string.
 * If the indicated input does not exist or the indicated input does not have the address,
 * the attestation request is rejected.
 * The `sourceAddress` is the address of the indicated transaction input.
 * - `spentAmount` is the sum of values of all inputs with sourceAddress minus the sum of
 * all outputs with `sourceAddress`.
 * Can be negative.
 * - `blockTimestamp` is the mediantime of a block.
 *
 * ### XRPL
 *
 * - `sourceAddressIndicator` is the standard address hash of the address whose balance has been decreased.
 * If the address indicated by `sourceAddressIndicator` is not among the signers of the transaction and the balance
 * of the address was not lowered in the transaction, the attestation request is rejected.
 *
 * - `spentAmount` is the difference between the balance of the indicated address after and before the transaction.
 * Can be negative.
 * - `blockTimestamp` is the close_time of a ledger converted to unix time.
 *
 * @custom:lut `blockTimestamp`
 * @custom:lutlimit `0x127500`, `0x127500`, `0x127500`

 * @notice A relay of a transaction on an external chain that is considered a payment in a native currency.
 * Various blockchains support different types of native payments. For each blockchain, it is specified how a payment
 * transaction should be formed to be provable by this attestation type.
 * The provable payments emulate traditional banking payments from entity A to entity B in native currency with an
 * optional payment reference.
 * @custom:verification The transaction with `transactionId` is fetched from the API of the blockchain node or
 * relevant indexer.
 * If the transaction cannot be fetched or the transaction is in a block that does not have a sufficient
 * [number of confirmations](/specs/attestations/configs.md#finalityconfirmation), the attestation request is rejected.
 *
 * Once the transaction is received, the payment summary is computed according to the rules for the source chain.
 * If the summary is successfully calculated, the response is assembled from the summary.
 * `blockNumber` and `blockTimestamp` are retrieved from the block if they are not included in the transaction data.
 * For Bitcoin and Dogecoin, `blockTimestamp` is mediantime of the block.
 * For XRPL, `blockTimestamp` is close time of the ledger converted to UNIX time.
 *
 * If the summary is not successfully calculated, the attestation request is rejected.
 * @custom:lut `blockTimestamp`
 * @custom:lutlimit `0x127500`, `0x127500`, `0x127500`

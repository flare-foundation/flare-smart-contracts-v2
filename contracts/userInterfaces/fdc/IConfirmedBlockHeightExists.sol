 * @custom:supported BTC, DOGE, XRP
 * @author Flare
 * @notice An assertion that a block with `blockNumber` is confirmed.
 * It also provides data to compute the block production rate in the given time range.
 * @custom:verification It is checked that the block with `blockNumber` is confirmed by at
 * least `numberOfConfirmations`.
 * If it is not, the request is rejected. We note a block on the tip of the chain is confirmed by 1 block.
 * Then `lowestQueryWindowBlock` is determined and its number and timestamp are extracted.
 *
 *
 * Current confirmation heights consensus:
 *
 *
 * | `Chain` | `chainId` | `numberOfConfirmations` | `timestamp ` |
 * | ------- | --------- | ----------------------- | ------------ |
 * | `BTC`   | 0         | 6                       | mediantime   |
 * | `DOGE`  | 2         | 60                      | mediantime   |
 * | `XRP`   | 3         | 3                       | close_time   |
